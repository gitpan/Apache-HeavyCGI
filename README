DEAD PROJECT, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE.

I WOULD NOT START A NEW PROJECT WITH THIS FRAMEWORK ANYMORE.

Historically interesting, most ideas implemented here were correct,
but time has moved on and as it has never got up to speed, it just
bitrotted and is far behind today's solutions.

The only reason I make a new release is to remove the pseudo hashes so
that I can continue to use it in my old projects with perl 5.10ff.

Upgrade instructions:
---------------------

Remove 'use fields' and any use of global %FIELDS hashes in your code.
All HeavyCGI related objects are now ordinary hashes without any bells
and whistles.
