What this example does
----------------------

This example is quite well suited as a template. It generates an
application with basic user authentication with a single simple table
layout:

    +------+------+
    |      |      |
    | LAY  | out  |
    |      |      |
    +------+------+
    | Hello| Hello|
    | user,| world|
    |      |      |
    +------+------+

It's really just a Hello world program. If I were you, I'd find it
intimidating, that a Hello world program can need over 100 lines of
code in 5 files. But believe me, I do know that the productivity of
HeavyCGI starts well beyond Hello World programs, and I really do use
this template whenever I start programming on a new application.

Howto install
-------------

Put all files into any directory that your Apache can see and add to
your httpd.conf something along these lines:

<PERL>

use lib "/your/path/to/Apache-HeavyCGI/eg";
my $loc = "/heavycgi_demo";
$Location{$loc}{SetHandler} = "perl-script";
$Location{$loc}{PerlHandler} = "heavy_template::config";
$Location{$loc}{PerlAuthenHandler} = "heavy_template::fake_authen_user";
$Location{$loc}{AuthName} = "Login_with_any_name";
$Location{$loc}{AuthType} = "Basic";
$Location{$loc}{require} = "valid-user";

</PERL>

Then you can access the demo with http://your.webserver/heavycgi_demo
