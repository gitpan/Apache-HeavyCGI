	* Funeral, kind of. I'll continue to use Apache::HeavyCGI in
	legacy projects but will move away from it on the next occasion.

	The README is not a manpage anymore but an eulogy (as leo
	translates "Grabrede").

	* Execution plan is now mandatory. A call to prepare will die if
	there is no execution plan in the Apache::HeavyCGI object.

	* Execution plan now cleaner and more useful than ever before:
	DEBUG and WATCHVARIABLE can be set for debugging and WALKTYPE can
	be set for avoiding method call overhead.

	* lib/Apache/HeavyCGI.pm: we now have all form widgets coded as in
	CGI.pm. The reason why we do that is: CGI.pm is slow but we like
	the interfce it provides.

	* Apache::HeavyCGI::Date now without 'use fields'. It has been
	observed that use fields can cause core dumps under up to now
	unknown conditions. Maybe it's due to the combination of overload
	and fields pragma? I don't know, but I need to be cautious:-(

	* Improvements on Exeplan: DEBUG and FUNCTIONAL as instance
	variables

	* Shortcut makes faster and more flexible instance_of method

	* Fixed an uninitialized warning in SquidRemoteAddr and
	HeavyCGI.pm

	* $@ was checked for isa, but isa() was a method call instead of
	an UNIVERSAL::isa function call.

1999-08-16  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* ExePlan now executes the plan as a series of function calls
	instead of method calls. Only a little bit benchmarked and seems
	to be a little bit better. Can be switched back to method calls by
	manually setting FUNCTIONAL to false

	* can_utf8 now reflects the protocol. HTTP/1.1 allows UTF-8 unless
	they have an Accept-Encoding header
