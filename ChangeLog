	* ExePlan now executes the plan as a series of function calls
	instead of method calls. Only a little bit benchmarked and seems
	to be a little bit better. Can be switched back to method calls by
	manually setting FUNCTIONAL to false

	* can_utf8 now reflects the protocol. HTTP/1.1 allows UTF-8 unless
	they have an Accept-Encoding header
