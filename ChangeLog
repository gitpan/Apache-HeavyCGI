	* Improvements on Exeplan: DEBUG and FUNCTIONAL as instance
	variables

	* Shortcut makes faster and more flexible instance_of method

	* Fixed an uninitialized warning in SquidRemoteAddr and
	HeavyCGI.pm

	* $@ was checked for isa, but isa() was a method call instead of
	an UNIVERSAL::isa function call.

	* ExePlan now executes the plan as a series of function calls
	instead of method calls. Only a little bit benchmarked and seems
	to be a little bit better. Can be switched back to method calls by
	manually setting FUNCTIONAL to false

	* can_utf8 now reflects the protocol. HTTP/1.1 allows UTF-8 unless
	they have an Accept-Encoding header
